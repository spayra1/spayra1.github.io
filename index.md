# Portfolio

_Thanks for visiting! On this page, I have links/summaries for some of the projects I've worked on, in reverse chronological order. You can also find links to my LinkedIn profile and GitHub repositories on the left._

_I also have many projects I've worked on that haven't included on this page. Check back for more later!_
_GitHub Pages has been having some issues displaying content and I haven't had time to troubleshoot it, so this page is slightly sparser than it was before_
